# Simple_Linear_Regression
A Jupyter Notebook–based implementation of Simple Linear Regression from scratch using NumPy, focused on building an intuitive understanding of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The project manually computes model parameters and evaluation metrics, visualizes results, and validates them against scikit-learn using the ISLP Advertising dataset.
